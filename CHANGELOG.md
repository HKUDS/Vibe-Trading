# Changelog

All notable changes to Vibe-Trading are documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### UI
- Redesigned the interactive CLI startup and run-state visuals with a large
  figlet-style banner plus a Claude Code-style activity rail using `●`, `│`,
  and `·` glyphs. Non-TTY prompt runs now fall back to plain text output.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-17

### Added — Alpha Zoo (450+ pre-built quant alphas)
- `agent/src/factors/` — base operators (`rank`, `scale`, `ts_*`, `delta`,
  `decay_linear`, `signed_power`, `safe_div`, market-aware `vwap`) and a
  registry that AST-extracts metadata from each alpha module without
  importing it. Lookahead is enforced at the operator level
  (`delta(d>=1)`), and registry sanity checks reject `+/-inf` and
  outputs that are more than 95 % NaN.
- 4 zoos shipping 452 alphas total:
  - **qlib158** (154 alphas) — port of Microsoft Qlib's `Alpha158`
    feature handler under Apache-2.0, with pinned commit SHA per file.
  - **alpha101** (101 alphas) — implementation of Kakushadze (2015)
    *"101 Formulaic Alphas"* (arXiv:1601.00991), written from the paper
    appendix; the relevant trademarked string is intentionally absent.
  - **gtja191** (191 alphas) — implementation of Guotai Junan's 2014
    *"191 Short-period Trading Alpha Factors"* research report.
  - **academic** (6 factors) — Fama-French 5 + Carhart momentum, shipped
    as honest price-based proxies (not the canonical FF series).
- `vibe-trading alpha {list,show,bench,compare,export-manifest}` CLI
  subcommand. `show` and `export-manifest` enforce path-traversal guards.
- New agent tools: `AlphaZooTool` (browse) and `AlphaBenchTool`
  (orchestrator with Jinja2 autoescape + strict CSP HTML report).
- `ZooSignalEngine.from_zoo(...)` — composite multi-factor signal engine
  with cross-sectional standardisation, weighting, and optional top-N /
  bottom-N long-short conversion.
- `wiki/scripts/build_alpha_library.py` — Alpha Library renderer.
  Reads `manifest.json` produced by `vibe-trading alpha export-manifest`
  and emits 452 per-alpha HTML pages plus 4 per-zoo overviews, each with
  `script-src 'none'` CSP. The landing page hydrates per-zoo counts
  from `content/index.json`.
- New blog post: *"Which of the 191 GTJA alphas still work in 2026?"*
  with aggregate IC statistics, theme breakdown, and the top alphas
  that survive eight years of out-of-sample data.

### Added — Web UI for Alpha Zoo
- New page at `/alpha-zoo` in the Vite + React frontend with three
  views: browse (4 zoo cards + filter bar + paginated table), detail
  (formula, metadata, collapsible source code), and bench-runner
  (form → SSE-streamed progress + Alive/Reversed/Dead stat cards +
  Top-5-by-IR table + by-theme breakdown chart). "Alpha Zoo" nav
  entry added to the layout.
- Four new REST routes in the FastAPI server:
  - `GET /alpha/list` — filterable alpha catalogue
  - `GET /alpha/{alpha_id}` — meta + source code
  - `POST /alpha/bench` — kicks off a background bench job and
    returns a `job_id`
  - `GET /alpha/bench/{job_id}/stream` — Server-Sent Events with
    `progress`, `result`, `done`, and `error` event types. In-memory
    job state with a 1-hour TTL; no Redis/Celery dependency.
- Bench math is refactored into `agent/src/factors/bench_runner.py`
  so the CLI driver (`agent/scripts/w4a_run_benches.py`) and the new
  API worker share a single implementation.

### Added — Safety floor
- `agent/tests/factors/test_alpha_purity.py` — AST allowlist scan over
  every `zoo/**/*.py` module (whitelist: pandas, numpy, scipy.\*,
  `src.factors.base`, `__future__`, `typing`, `math`, `dataclasses`;
  banned: `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `socket`, `urllib`, `requests`,
  `httpx`, `pathlib`, `Path`, `open`, `eval`, `exec`, `compile`,
  `__import__`, and `getattr(_, "__*")`).
- `agent/tests/factors/test_lookahead.py` — sentinel future-row
  injection on a 300-row synthetic panel; corrupting rows after the
  probe must leave the probe value unchanged within 1e-9.
- `tools/ci_grep_gates.sh` — CI gate that rejects `yaml.load(` without
  `safe_load`, any trademarked-name leak in shipped artifacts, and any
  per-stock-code data leak in `wiki/**/*.{json,csv,html}`.
- `agent/tests/factors/conftest.py` — opt-in `pytest-socket` integration
  that hard-fails any test attempting outbound network during the
  factors test suite.

### Added — Community governance
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
  requirement and a contributor checklist for new alpha PRs (purity,
  lookahead, `__alpha_meta__` shape, LaTeX-matches-code, per-zoo
  LICENSE.md, DCO).
- `NOTICE` (repo root) — Apache-2.0 attribution for Qlib and a
  declaration that the bundled formulas from Kakushadze, GTJA, and the
  academic baselines are mathematical content (paper prose, tables, and
  figures are not reproduced here).
- Per-zoo `LICENSE.md` for each of `qlib158/`, `alpha101/`, `gtja191/`,
  and `academic/`, plus an upstream `NOTICE` for `qlib158/`.

### Changed
- `agent/src/tools/factor_analysis_tool.py` extracted its IC/IR and
  layered-backtest helpers to `agent/src/factors/factor_analysis_core.py`
  so the new `alpha_bench_tool` reuses the same maths. Public tool
  signature is unchanged; `_compute_ic_series` and `_compute_group_equity`
  remain importable as backward-compatible aliases.
- `agent/cli.py` grew by 7 lines to register the `alpha` subcommand;
  all handler logic lives in `agent/src/factors/cli_handlers.py`.
- Packaging: `pyproject.toml` now ships `zoo/**/*.yaml`, `zoo/**/*.md`,
  and `zoo/**/NOTICE` as package data; `MANIFEST.in` recursively
  includes `agent/src/factors`.

### Known limitations
- The `btc-usdt` universe is single-asset; cross-sectional IC requires
  ≥2 instruments, so the bundled `alpha101_btc` bench run returns
  alive/reversed/dead = 0/0/0 by construction. Use a multi-symbol crypto
  basket (e.g. BTC + ETH + SOL + the top-N perpetuals) for meaningful
  cross-sectional results; a curated `crypto-majors` universe is planned
  for 0.2.

### Internal
- `wiki/alpha-library/manifest.json` and `wiki/alpha-library/content/`
  are generated artifacts and gitignored. Run
  `vibe-trading alpha export-manifest --out wiki/alpha-library/manifest.json
  --force` followed by `python wiki/scripts/build_alpha_library.py` to
  regenerate the static site.

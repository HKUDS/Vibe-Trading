## Data Source Overview

| Source | Markets | Auth Required | Network | Skill |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|-------|
| tushare | A-shares, funds, futures, macro | Yes (`TUSHARE_TOKEN`) | China network | tushare |
| akshare | A-shares, US, HK, futures, macro, forex | No | Unrestricted | akshare |
| yfinance | US stocks, HK stocks, ETFs | No | Needs Yahoo Finance access | yfinance |
| okx | Crypto (OKX exchange) | No | Needs okx.com access | okx-market |
| ccxt | Crypto (100+ exchanges) | No | Needs exchange access | ccxt |

## Decision Tree

### Backtest Scenario (writing config.json)

Use `source: "auto"` — the runner automatically routes by symbol pattern and falls back to alternative sources if the primary one is unavailable.

You do NOT need to specify a concrete data source in config.json unless the user explicitly asks for one.

Exception:

- If the strategy is **A-share** and uses **financial statement fields** from Tushare tables such as `income`, `balancesheet`, `cashflow`, `express`, or `fina_indicator`, do **not** rely on generic fallback routing.
- In that case, use the gating rules from [ashare-financial-enrichment](../ashare-financial-enrichment/SKILL.md): `TUSHARE_TOKEN` is mandatory, and the flow must not silently downgrade to AKShare.

### Analysis / Research Scenario (writing Python scripts)

1. Identify the market type from the user's request
2. Pick the source by priority:

**A-shares**: tushare (if TUSHARE_TOKEN is set) > akshare (free fallback)
For A-share financial statement enrichment, this fallback rule does **not** apply — use strict Tushare only.
**US stocks**: yfinance > akshare
**HK stocks**: yfinance > akshare
**Crypto**: okx (single exchange) > ccxt (multi-exchange)
**Futures**: tushare > akshare
**Macro / economics**: akshare > tushare
**Forex**: akshare > yfinance

3. Load the corresponding skill for API details: `load_skill("akshare")`

### Availability Check

- **tushare**: check if `TUSHARE_TOKEN` environment variable exists
- **yfinance / okx / ccxt / akshare**: free but may have network restrictions
- If the user reports "connection timeout" or "cannot access", switch to the same-market fallback

## Symbol Format Reference

| Market | Format | Examples |
|--------|--------|---------|
| A-shares | `NNNNNN.SZ/SH/BJ` | 000001.SZ, 600000.SH |
| US stocks | `TICKER.US` | AAPL.US, MSFT.US |
| HK stocks | `NNN(N).HK` | 700.HK, 9988.HK |
| Crypto | `SYMBOL-USDT` | BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT |
| Futures | `XXNNNN.EXCHANGE` | CU2406.SHFE |
| Forex | `XXX/YYY` | USD/CNY, EUR/USD |

## Fallback Chain (Runner Layer)

The backtest runner implements automatic fallback at the market level:

```
User requests 000001.SZ (A-share)
  -> detect market: a_share
  -> try tushare: TUSHARE_TOKEN missing -> skip
  -> try akshare: available -> use akshare
  -> success (zero config required)
```

This is transparent to the user — they just see results.

Important carve-out:

- The transparent fallback chain is appropriate for price data and simple A-share `daily_basic` fields.
- It is **not** appropriate for A-share financial statement strategies that depend on `income`, `balancesheet`, `cashflow`, `express`, or `fina_indicator`.
- For those strategies, if `TUSHARE_TOKEN` is missing, stop and wait for the user's decision instead of routing to AKShare.
